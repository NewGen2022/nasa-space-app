# Summary
MarsHab Architect is an interactive web-based simulation tool that allows users to design and experiment with modular space habitats for planetary environments like Mars. Built with React and Phaser, the tool combines intuitive interface elements with an interactive 2D grid world where users can define habitat shapes, adjust their dimensions, assign crew, and visualize spatial layouts under realistic terrain conditions.

The project addresses NASA’s challenge of creating an accessible, user-friendly system for planning space habitats that meet critical constraints — including limited volume, crew capacity, and terrain variability. Users can experiment with shape, area, and crew configurations, paint elevation maps to simulate planetary surfaces, and receive real-time feedback if placement rules (like uneven terrain) are violated.
This tool bridges education and engineering by making habitat design both visual and hands-on. It empowers students, researchers, and space enthusiasts to explore how living conditions, geometry, and environment interact — a key step toward sustainable human presence on other worlds.

MarsHab Architect is an interactive simulation and educational tool designed to help users visualize, design, and test conceptual space habitats for Mars. 

Users can configure habitat geometry, area, and crew size; adjust planetary terrain using an elevation brush; and observe how design decisions affect structural feasibility and crew distribution. 

The simulation dynamically checks conditions like terrain slope, available living space, and population constraints, providing instant feedback when requirements are violated.

The system is built using React.js, Phaser.js, and JavaScript (ES6), chosen for their real-time rendering, modular architecture and fast prototyping. 

Visuals are handled on a 2D tile grid, allowing users to experiment with different shapes, terrain heights, and layout strategies. The app combines elements of simulation, interactive visualization, and game design to make complex engineering logic intuitive and engaging.

The project’s goal is to bridge education and exploration — enabling students, researchers, and engineers to understand how terrain, habitat structure, and crew capacity interact in extraterrestrial environments. 

It promotes creative thinking about sustainability, spatial efficiency, and the realities of living on other worlds.


# Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI tools were used to assist with optimization guidance and work with Phaser (because there is no background with it previously)

Example of a sample challenge geared toward grades 3 to 6 on designing the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO). Astronauts living aboard HALO will have to carry out a variety of essential tasks, including conducting experiments, eating, resting, and exercising all within a space no larger than a small school bus. https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/youth-educators/activities/multi-functionality-in-space.asp
